# üí∞ Budget Helper

**Budget Helper** is a web app built with **React** and **Vite** that helps families track and manage their **debts, bills, and payments** more easily.  
The app connects directly to an **Airtable backend**, allowing users to add and view their expenses, payments, and outstanding balances in real time ‚Äî all from an easy-to-use interface.

> ‚öôÔ∏è The **Bills page** is currently under construction and will be coming soon! Once finished, it will let users log recurring bills and track payments similar to how debts are tracked.
